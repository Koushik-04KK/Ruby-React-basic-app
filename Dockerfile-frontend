# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the frontend code
COPY frontend/ .

# Build the app (adjust the command if not using default 'npm run build')
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with a lightweight server (like Nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

# *** CORRECTED LINE HERE ***
# Copy the built files from the build stage to the Nginx content directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy a custom Nginx config (optional, but good practice for SPAs)

# Expose the Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# The default command runs Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
